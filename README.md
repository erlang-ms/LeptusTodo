## Todo List Application
It is an example about how to write a simple Todo application with [Leptus](https://github.com/s1n4/leptus), which is an Erlang RESTful micro-framework. Leptus built on top of [Cowboy](https://github.com/extend/cowboy).

There is a step-by-step tutorial about this repo in [this page](https://hamidreza-s.github.io/erlang/web/micro-framework/leptus/tutorial/2014/04/22/erlang-for-web-developers-with-leptus.html).
